  "articleText":"## AI Superpower: Cracking Open the Body Without Hurting It\n\nImagine being able to see inside your body without any harm or discomfort. A team of researchers from Caltech and Nvidia just took a huge leap towards making this a reality using artificial intelligence.\n\n### Main Points:\n\n* The team developed an AI model called Pano that can create 3D images of the inside of our bodies using sound waves, not X-rays.\n* This technology is called photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), and it's been around for a while, but was slow and expensive.\n* Pano skips the messy first step and looks directly at the raw sound signals to generate high-quality 3D images in just a tenth of a second.\n\n### Examples:\n\n* Think of it like taking a picture with a flash. The light bounces off objects, creating a clear image. In PACT, light energy heats up molecules inside the body, causing them to expand and create sound waves that are detected by sensors.\n* Imagine having a superpower that lets you see inside your skin without getting hurt or needing invasive procedures.\n\n### Wrap-up:\n\nThis research is a game-changer for medical imaging. With Pano, hospitals can use cheaper machines with less hardware and get faster, higher-quality scans, which could help detect cancer, study brain function, and guide surgeons in real-time. It's an amazing example of how AI can make our lives better and safer.",
