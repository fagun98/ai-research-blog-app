  "articleText": "## The Tiny Fish That Taught Us How to Hunt\n\nImagine you're on a mission to catch a fish. You swim around, using your eyes and brain to figure out where your prey is hiding. Sounds easy, right? But for a tiny zebrafish larva, hunting is a complex dance that requires precision and strategy.\n\n### Main Points\n\n* The researchers created a simple simulation of a petri dish with food floating around.\n* They gave the AI fish two eyes and three actions: swim forward, turn, and change the angle of its eyes (called convergence).\n* The AI's goal was to catch food efficiently by getting rewards for catching prey and penalties for wasting energy.\n\n### Examples\n\n* Think of it like training a puppy. You don't give it instructions; you just reward it when it does something good.\n* The researchers also tested the AI in different scenarios, such as with faster or slower prey, to see how it adapted its strategy.\n\nThis study shows us that complex behaviors can arise from simple principles. By letting the AI fish figure out how to hunt on its own, the researchers uncovered a surprising similarity between the virtual and real zebrafish. It turns out that their hunting strategies are not just random quirks of nature, but rather efficient solutions to a problem.\n\nThis research has implications for robotics, AI development, and even our understanding of animal behavior. Who knew that studying a tiny fish could be so insightful?",
