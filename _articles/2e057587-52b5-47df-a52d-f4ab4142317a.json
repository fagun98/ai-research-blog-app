  "articleText":"## The Latent Role of Open Models in the AI Economy\n\n### Catchy, Kid-Friendly Headline: How Open AI Comps Outsmart Secret AI Giants!\n\nThe paper \"The Latent Role of Open Models in the AI Economy\" is trying to figure out if open models can overtake secret models in popularity and price.\n\nThink about it like this: Imagine you have a secret recipe for amazing cookies, but everyone's using an almost as good recipe made public by your friend Sally. It's cheaper, and it tastes very close! But even though the public recipes are almost twice as cheap and just as delicious, more people keep stealing your secret recipe!\n\nThe paper finds out that in AI-land, this is happening with \"open models\" like Sally's cookies and \"closed models\" like yours. The open models might be cheaper and nearly as good at their tasks—but for some reason, the secret closed models are still popular among companies. Why? Maybe people are scared of using Sally’s recipes or they just really love that your cookies are super secret!\n\nIn simple terms, this paper shows us a big puzzle in how AI works today: why do open and cheaper models not become more popular? The answer is both mysterious (why be scared) and funny (cookie-recipe envy).\n\nThis matters because as AI becomes part of our daily lives, understanding this puzzle can lead to better technology for everyone!",
