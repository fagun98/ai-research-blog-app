Sounds like science fiction? For Gen Z, it's just the beginning.\n\nResearchers at Crit Plus Career recently studied how young professionals are using AI in their work. The results are fascinating and show us how these digital natives are not only embracing technology but also using it to augment their skills and take control of their careers.\n\n### From Bottom-Up Innovation\n\nOne surprising finding is that Gen Z is driving innovation from the bottom up. They're creating custom AI agents, experimenting with new tools, and even mentoring senior leaders on how to use AI effectively. It's like having a team of tech-savvy interns who are changing the game!\n\n### Critical Thinking Matters\n\nBut here's the catch: while these young professionals are mastering AI, they also know when to loop in human judgment for the hard stuff. They're not just relying on algorithms; they're using them as a tool to make better decisions.\n\n### A New Era of Mutual Mentorship\n\nThe study highlights an interesting twist \u2013 Gen Z values traditional experience and tenure more than millennials do. This suggests that the future workplace requires a two-way street: juniors teaching tech, seniors coaching strategy and leadership.\n\nSo what does this mean for you? It means that as AI takes over routine tasks, managers will need to focus on developing the uniquely human skills that define leadership \u2013 strategic discernment, interpersonal dynamics, and nuanced judgment. The stakes are high, but with a new generation of leaders at the helm, we might just see a future where humans thrive alongside technology.\n\nThe ultimate control of your career path stays firmly in human hands. Time to take the reins!",
