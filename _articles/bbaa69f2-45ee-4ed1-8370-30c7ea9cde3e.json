That's roughly what happened in a recent study on how to manipulate large language models (LLMs), like those used in chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\nResearchers discovered a clever way to trick LLMs by inserting tiny \"poisons\" into their training data. These poisons are essentially faulty steps that make the AI follow an incorrect line of reasoning. But here's the twist: these attacks don't always leave behind clear evidence. Sometimes, the AI will self-correct and avoid the poisoned path altogether.\n\nTo understand how this works, imagine teaching a student to solve a math problem. You might show them a few examples with correct steps, but also include some subtly flawed reasoning. If the student is exposed to enough of these poisoned examples, they might start using the flawed logic in their own work.\n\nThe researchers found that even when the AI generates an answer that looks perfectly fine, it's possible that the poison was never actually used. Instead, the AI might have ignored the flawed steps and still reached the correct answer. This raises questions about how much we can trust the explanations provided by these models.\n\nThe study also revealed a clever trick used by attackers to overcome the AI's self-correction mechanism. They introduced \"go-to markers,\" which are essentially special tokens that tell the AI to jump from one line of reasoning to another, specifically towards the poisoned path.\n\nThis research highlights how vulnerable LLMs can be to these subtle attacks. It also raises concerns about the potential for unintended biases or malicious detours within the models we rely on every day.\n\nIn short, this paper is a fascinating but unsettling reminder that our AI systems are still far from perfect.",
