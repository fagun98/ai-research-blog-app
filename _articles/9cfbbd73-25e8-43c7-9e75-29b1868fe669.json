  "articleText":"# A CPU-Centric Perspective on Agentic AI\n\nAt Georgia Tech and Intel, a team of smart people decided to play detective on a super new kind of AI. This AI wants to act like your friendly owl neighbor - planning trips, booking flights, and even finding you the best hotel in Rome! But they found out something funny: it's not all about those powerful graphics cards (GPUs) everyone loves, but also the humble CPU, or central processing unit, that powers our computers.\n\n## Catchy, Kid-Friendly Headline: \"Owl-Loving AI: The Secret to Super Fast Thinking!\"\n\n### Imagine if your friend is a computer and you're the AI trying to book a flight. Every time your friend gets a new command, they have to check their computer (CPU) for more tasks - searching the web, writing emails or even opening files. But instead of doing all these at once, they did it in two smaller groups like when we share our playtime with friends. This way, it's much faster and saves energy too!\n\n### So what? Well, this means that if you want lots of AI agents to work together like a soccer team, CPU is the one who tells them where to kick the ball next. But, they noticed something scary too: too many tasks at once can make all the players (CPU cores) exhausted and confused!\n\n### In the end, the researchers found out two ways to fix this - CGAM and Mass. They're like traffic cops for the AI agents who ensure everyone is getting enough playtime without overloading the CPUs with too much work or energy.\n\n## Why does it matter? Think about when you ask your smart assistant Siri where the best ice cream shop in town is. This new kind of AI can do more and faster, but only if we fix these problems first. Isn't that cool?",
