  "articleText":"## Title: The Future of 3D Models - with AI's Help!\n\n### Introduction\nHave you ever wished that your favorite 3D toy could listen and understand all your desires? Well, scientists have come one step closer to making it possible. A new research paper named \"Part-Aware 3D Multimodal Large Language Model\" is doing just that, using an artificial intelligence (AI) system for creating a special language for models. Let's get into this fascinating journey together!\n\n### Main Idea Explained\nThe researchers had a big question - \"How can we make AI understand the relationships between different parts of 3D objects?\" They set out to design and test their hypothesis using simple analogies like basket liner change, wheel spoke and rim clustering. The result was more than expected with huge performance improvement.\n\n### Surprising or Fun Results\nThe most surprising outcome for researchers could be \"semantic granularity control\". Just by understanding the token descriptions in 3D models, AI can also automatically segment faces of different parts leading to smoother interactions between model and your desires! Isn't that cool?\n\n### Serious Side Too\nThis technology isn’t all fun though. In a more serious perspective, if we misuse this technology, dangerous practices like unsafe habits could be propagated too. Just like when one person picks up an unwanted habit and it gets passed on to other friends till it becomes common, models with \"bad\" AI might spread bad habits!\n\n### Why It Matters\nImagine a future where you can design your dream model by just speaking about its details. Your AI model could understand every tiny detail you want in it. All this is possible now due to the work of scientists on 'Part-Aware 3D Multimodal Large Language Model' and such innovative AI systems!\n\n### Wrap-up: This \"Part-Aware 3D Multimodal Large Language Model\" research paper is an exciting step towards a future where AI becomes not just your assistant but also a co-designer with you, leading us into a new world of design possibilities. The study opens up numerous potential applications and might redefine our relationship with 3D models in the coming days!",
