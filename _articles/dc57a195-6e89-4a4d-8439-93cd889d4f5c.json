  "articleText": "## How AI Can Finally Understand Your Website Like You Do!\n\nImagine having an assistant that can actually help you find what you need online without getting stuck. Sounds like a dream, right? But with a new system called Walt, this might be closer to reality than we think.\n\n**Current Limitations of AI Agents**\n\nCurrent AI agents are like clumsy humans trying to navigate a website by copying every single click and step. They're too brittle and can break easily if the website changes its layout or design.\n\n**Introducing Walt: A Game-Changer in Web Assistance**\n\nWalt is different because it \"reverse engineers\" websites, learning how their tools work and using them directly. This approach makes the idea of an autonomous web assistant much more realistic.\n\n**How Walt Works**\n\nThink of Walt like a smart student who figures out that a search bar on a website is actually a tool to find what you're looking for. No more endless clicking! Imagine being able to ask an AI to \"search.query equals blue kayak, category equals boats, sort by equals price\" and having it understand exactly what you mean.\n\n**The Future of Web Assistance**\n\nWalt's innovative approach makes the idea of an autonomous web assistant much more realistic. It's a fundamental shift in how we approach the problem of getting AI to work with websites. With Walt, we might finally have a tool that can help us find our perfect blue kayak online without getting bogged down by tiny details.\n\nThis system has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with websites and make our online experiences more efficient and enjoyable.",
