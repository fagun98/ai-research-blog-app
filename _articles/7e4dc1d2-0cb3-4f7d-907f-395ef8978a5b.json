  "articleText": "## How to Predict Stock Market Winners (and Losers)? A Secret Recipe from AI Experts\n\nImagine you're trying to guess which stocks will go up or down in value. You have two tools: a math report card for each stock, and a journalist who reads all the latest news about it.\n\n**Combine numbers with AI news analysis**: Researchers tried mixing together the math report cards (quantitative factors) and the journalist's summaries of financial news (news flow representations). To their surprise, a simple combination worked really well!\n\n* **Just like too many toppings can ruin a smoothie**, adding too much noise from the news can dilute the useful info from the numbers. Instead, an \"expert chef\" model was developed that learned when to trust each type of information.\n* **The secret sauce is adaptability**: By training the expert chef in stages (first just with numbers, then with both numbers and news), the researchers created a more stable and effective model.\n\n**Think of the math report card as your phone's weather app. You get a clear picture of the stock's \"weather\" \u2013 its current value, growth rate, and stability.**\n\n* The journalist's summary is like a friend who tells you about all the latest news related to that company. But just like how too much gossip can be overwhelming, some news might not be helpful.\n\n**Combining old-school data with new-school AI analysis can indeed improve stock predictions! But the key is to do it thoughtfully and adaptively. By being aware of when to trust each type of information, you can make more accurate guesses about which stocks will rise or fall in value.",
