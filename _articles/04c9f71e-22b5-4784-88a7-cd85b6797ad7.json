  "articleText": "**AI Scammers' Secret Stung: How 'Paladin' Stops Phishing Emails in Their Tracks**\n\nImagine getting an email that looks super legit, but is actually trying to trick you into clicking on a dodgy link. It's like a phishing scam, but way more sneaky. Researchers have just come up with a clever solution called \"Paladin\" that helps catch these fake emails before they reach your inbox.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nPhishing scams are getting super good at writing convincing emails that look like they're from real people or companies.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nPaladin is a system that trains AI models to secretly insert a \"tag\" into the email whenever it's used for something malicious. This tag can be detected by security systems, which can then block the email before it reaches your inbox.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nThink of it like a hidden label on a toy. When you buy a toy with a label that says \"Not for Children,\" the store knows to keep it out of reach. Paladin works similarly, but instead of labels on toys, it's about AI models inserting secret tags into emails.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Imagine you're trying to use a super powerful tool (like an AI model) to write convincing emails. You think you've got it under control, but what if someone sneaky took that tool and used it for something bad? Paladin helps prevent this by making the AI model \"tell on itself\" whenever it's used for malicious purposes.\n\n**Wrap-up**\n\nThis is a really cool solution because it doesn't require building an impenetrable fortress around our emails. Instead, it uses the same tools we're trying to protect ourselves with (AI models) to help catch scammers in the act. And the best part? It works like a charm \u2013 with over 90% detection accuracy!",
