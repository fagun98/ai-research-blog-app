  "articleText":"## Can We Trust Our AI? New Method to Catch Fake Answers\n\nImagine asking an AI for advice on something important, but it gives you a completely made-up answer. This is called a hallucination, and it's a big problem with how we use artificial intelligence today.\n\nResearchers have been working on a new way to detect these fake answers, and their method is based on some pretty cool ideas from physics.\n\n### The Problem of Hallucinations\n\nHallucinations are a major issue because they can lead to disastrous consequences. For example, if an AI gives you fake medical advice or legal information, it could have serious repercussions.\n\n### A New Method: Halo Field\n\nThe researchers have developed a new method called Halo Field, which uses the concept of \"free energy\" to measure how stable an answer is. Think of it like a ball in a valley - a good answer is like a stable, low-energy state. A hallucination is like a ball on top of a hill, waiting to roll away!\n\n### How It Works\n\nTo test their ideas, the researchers used a simple analogy: imagine the possible answers as hills and valleys in a landscape. By \"shaking\" this landscape (or turning up the AI's temperature setting), they can see how stable each answer is.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n* Imagine you ask an AI for the best recipe to make chocolate cake. A good answer would be like a ball in a valley - it's stable and doesn't change much when \"shaken\". But if the AI gives you a completely ridiculous recipe, that's like a ball on top of a hill - it changes dramatically when \"shaken\".\n* Think about how this could affect things we use every day. If an AI is giving us fake medical advice or legal information, that could be disastrous!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHalo Field is a big step forward in making AI more trustworthy and reliable. By using ideas from physics to measure the stability of answers, researchers can catch hallucinations before they cause harm. It's an exciting example of how science and technology are coming together to solve real-world problems.",
