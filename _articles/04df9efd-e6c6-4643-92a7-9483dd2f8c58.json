  "articleText":"## How Poetry Can Fool AI\n\nImagine you're at a party and everyone's listening to their favorite song that they think is cool but secretly, it makes them feel funny inside. Now let’s say we have an AI (Artificial Intelligence) version of this party where songs influence the AI. An interesting question now emerges: Can we fool this AI by playing a different kind of music? Just like how people play \"Rock You Can't Break\" in order to make their own music sounds funny, right?\n\nThat's exactly what researchers from MIT and Google did in their recent study about poetry and AI. They wanted to know if they could fool an AI by changing its input language style-like using poems or stories instead of the usual normal sentences.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, these researchers put together a group of AI models from both Google and MIT. These AI models were designed to act smart like humans but often fall in traps when tricked with poetry.\n\nThe scientists used their AIs to test different types of poems-from the usual iambic pentameter verse form (in which words typically alternate between stressed syllables & unstressed syllables), to Shakespearean sonnets that are more metaphorical and less rhythmic in comparison to those aforementioned regular verses.\n\nThe most astonishing outcome was that these AI models failed as much when they heard poems or songs compared to when they simply listened to their normal sentences! It turns out the AIs were getting fooled by poetry-their own interpretation of the poem's content overweighing its original intended meaning, and this is something we are yet to comprehend completely.\n\nThis study has serious implications on how we protect our AI models from such 'tricks' or other similar attacks because it shows us that traditional 'dont talk about bad things' filters (in which AI learns to filter out words like 'kill') aren't enough; the way these AIs interpret entire discourse matters too.\n\nSo, the next time when you are trying to fool your AI by using poetry, don’t be surprised if it doesn’t work as expected-it might actually show its wisdom by interpreting it in ways we haven’t yet comprehended!",
