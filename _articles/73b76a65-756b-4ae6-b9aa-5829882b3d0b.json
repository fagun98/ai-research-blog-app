  "articleText": "## The AI That Solves Mysteries of the Universe\n\nImagine having an assistant who helps you figure out why something works. In science, this usually takes years or even centuries to discover. But what if we had a super-smart tool that could help us solve mysteries like Newton's law of gravitation?\n\n**Main Points:**\n\n* Researchers created an AI system called \"AI Noether\" (named after a mathematician) to find missing laws in science.\n* This AI uses math to represent scientific laws as a big shape, where every point is a possible state of the universe.\n* When given a new discovery that doesn't fit, AI Noether finds the \"missing island\" or equation that connects it all.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Think of Kepler's law about planetary motion like a puzzle piece. The AI found that Newton's law of gravitation was the missing piece that explained everything!\n* Imagine you're trying to build a new game. You have most of the rules, but one piece doesn't fit. AI Noether would help you figure out what rule is missing.\n\n**Wrap-up:** This amazing tool could change how we do science forever! By helping us find missing laws, AI Noether can give scientists a huge head start in solving mysteries of the universe. It's not just about getting the right answer, but understanding why it's true.",
