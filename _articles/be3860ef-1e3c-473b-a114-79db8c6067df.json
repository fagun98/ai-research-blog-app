  "articleText": "## The Future Architects: What Teens Really Think About AI\n\nImagine you're a teenager, and you're asked to navigate a complex world of technology without any guidance. That's what millions of teens in Europe are facing right now with artificial intelligence (AI). But a recent report has some surprising insights into how they really feel about AI.\n\n### Teens Love AI, but Need Help\n\nThe report shows that 96% of older European teens use AI regularly for school and creative projects. They love how it helps them understand difficult topics and gets instant feedback on their work. One teen even said she asked an AI to explain a math problem in simple terms! It's clear they're embracing technology, but with some caveats.\n\n### A Disconnect Between Teens and Schools\n\nThe report highlights a worrying gap between teens and the institutions meant to guide them. Only 56% of teens say their school has approved any AI tools, leaving many to navigate the digital world without proper guidance. This is like flying an airplane without a pilot's license!\n\n### Teens Want Rules, Not Wild West\n\nDespite this chaos, teens aren't asking for complete freedom. They're seeking structure and rules to help them use AI responsibly. Some even suggest creating a \"rulebook\" for AI usage in schools! It's clear they want to learn how to harness technology for good.\n\n### A Call to Action for Adults\n\nThe report's authors urge adults to take notice and act. By teaching teens about digital literacy, age-appropriate experiences, and shared responsibility, we can empower them to build a better future with AI. What's at stake? A lot. If we wait until they're adults to teach them how to use these tools responsibly, the cost could be higher than we think.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis report is a wake-up call for all of us. It shows that teens are not just passive users of technology but active architects of their digital futures. Let's listen to what they have to say and work together to create a safer, more inclusive online world. The future depends on it!",
