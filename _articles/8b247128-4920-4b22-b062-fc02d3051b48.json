  "articleText": "## Meet the AI Committee: How a Group of Friends Helped Each Other Get Smarter\n\nImagine you have a tricky math problem. Who would you ask for help? A single super-smart friend or a group of friends with different strengths? The researchers behind this paper thought, \"Why not ask a bunch of artificial intelligences (AIs) to work together?\" And they came up with an innovative way to make AI better at solving complex problems.\n\n### Main Ideas\n\n* They called their approach the \"Roundtable Policy,\" where multiple AIs discuss and learn from each other.\n* Each AI is given a score for its accuracy, kind of like a report card.\n* The scores are then used to create a reputation table that shows which AIs excel in specific areas.\n\n### Examples\n\nThink of it like a school project. If you're working on a science paper and need help with biology, but your friend is an expert at chemistry, wouldn't it be great if you could get their input too?\n\nImagine a group of AI \"students\" taking turns answering questions and sharing their insights. They learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses.\n\n### What This Means\n\nThis research shows that when AIs work together, they can produce more accurate answers than individual geniuses. It's like having a team of experts, not just one super-smart friend. The Roundtable Policy is an exciting development in AI, making it more reliable and accountable for solving complex problems.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n* All ages can follow the story.\n* Plain words only; hard terms are explained instantly.\n* 2-3 short, fun examples included.\n* No section is too long; the whole piece is under 400 words.",
