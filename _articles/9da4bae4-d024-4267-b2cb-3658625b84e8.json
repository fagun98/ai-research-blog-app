  "articleText":"# Grounded by Experience: Gen Healthcare Prediction Augmented with Hierarchical Agentic Retrieval\n\n## Intro\nImagine an artificial intelligence (AI) doctor who can make reliable predictions without hallucinating about things that aren't true! That's what a team of scientists tried to achieve. Their paper, \"Grounded by Experience\", is like the storybook for this smarter AI in medicine.\n\n## Main points\n- The old doctors (AI models) were too quick to make guesses without knowing much about diseases. They were like kids guessing on a test without studying!\n- The new doctors are more patient and smart. Instead of guessing, they ask questions and look up answers wisely. They have their own rules for when to consult or stop asking questions!\n- Surprisingly, the smarter AI models worked well even with fewer resources (like being smaller in size), which is like having a small book that fits in your pocket but still has all the knowledge you need. \n\n## Examples\n1. Imagine if you had a big toy box but sometimes you just want to play with specific toys—the new AI doctor only looks for answers when it needs them, not every time! This is like having only one book on dinosaurs and knowing what you need about each dinosaur without flipping through the whole book every time.\n2. If your friend tells you they have a disease that isn't real in medicine, the new AI doctor won't just accept it. It says, \"Hmm, I don't think so\" before even looking up information! \n\n## Wrap-up\nThis smarter AI doctor will help make our lives safer and healthier by giving us better advice on medical matters. So next time you see a real doctor, imagine they have an AI assistant to keep everyone in the best shape possible!",
