  "articleText": "### How Do Computers See?\n\nHave you ever wondered how your phone can instantly recognize your face to unlock? Or how Google Photos automatically groups your vacation pictures? This is all thanks to **Computer Vision** - a field of AI that teaches computers to understand and interpret visual information.\n\n## What is Computer Vision?\n\nComputer Vision is like giving eyes to computers. Just like you can look at a photo and immediately know it's a sunset over mountains, computer vision helps machines understand what they're \"seeing\" in images and videos.\n\n## How Does It Work?\n\nImagine teaching a child to recognize animals:\n\n### Step 1: Break It Down\nInstead of looking at the whole picture at once, the computer examines tiny pieces (pixels) and looks for patterns - edges, shapes, colors, and textures.\n\n### Step 2: Find Features\n- Does it have four legs? → Might be an animal\n- Does it have fur? → Could be a mammal\n- Does it have stripes? → Might be a tiger\n\n### Step 3: Make Connections\nJust like you learned that \"four legs + fur + stripes = tiger\", the computer learns these connections through thousands of examples.\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\n- **Medical Imaging**: Detecting tumors in X-rays\n- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Recognizing traffic signs and pedestrians\n- **Social Media**: Automatically tagging friends in photos\n- **Security**: Facial recognition systems\n- **Agriculture**: Monitoring crop health from satellite images\n\n## The Learning Process\n\nComputers don't start knowing what a cat looks like. They learn by:\n\n1. Looking at millions of cat photos\n2. Being told \"this is a cat\" for each photo\n3. Gradually learning the patterns that make a cat a cat\n4. Eventually being able to identify cats in new photos they've never seen\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nComputer Vision is transforming our world by making machines more helpful and intelligent. From helping doctors save lives to making our phones smarter, it's one of the most exciting areas of AI today!\n\n## Simple Analogy\n\nThink of computer vision like teaching someone who has never seen a cat before. You'd show them many cat pictures, point out the features (whiskers, pointy ears, etc.), and eventually they'd be able to spot cats anywhere. That's exactly what we do with computers!",
