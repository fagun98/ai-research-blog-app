  "articleText": "## Code Evolve: An open source evolutionary coding agent for algorithm discovery and optimization\n\nImagine having a super-smart programmer who never gets tired or makes mistakes. Sounds like science fiction, right? But what if I told you that researchers have created an AI system called Code Evolve that can learn and improve its coding skills all by itself?\n\n**How it works**\n\nCode Evolve uses two powerful ideas: large language models (LLMs) and genetic algorithms.\n\n* LLMs are like super-smart assistants that can understand code and write new programs.\n* Genetic algorithms are inspired by evolution, where the \"fittest\" solutions get to reproduce and create new offspring.\n* Code Evolve brings these two ideas together, using an LLM as a \"breeder\" to combine the best features of different programs into something even better.\n\n**Examples**\n\nThink of genetic algorithms like breeding horses. You start with a population of horses, test them to see who's the fastest, and then breed the winners to create an even faster generation. Code Evolve does the same thing with code, but instead of horses, it uses AI to combine the best parts of different programs.\n\n**The benefits**\n\nSo what's the big deal about Code Evolve? This open-source system not only matches (and often beats) the performance of a closed-source system from Google, but it also shows that collaboration and transparency can lead to better results. It's like having a super-smart team of programmers who work together to solve problems!",
