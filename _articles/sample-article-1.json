  "articleText": "# What are Neural Networks?\n\nNeural networks are computer systems inspired by how our brains work. Just like our brain has neurons connected to each other, a neural network has artificial neurons (called nodes) connected in layers.\n\n## How Do They Learn?\n\nThink of it like teaching a child to recognize cats:\n\n1. **Show Examples**: You show the child many pictures of cats and dogs\n2. **Make Guesses**: The child guesses \"cat\" or \"dog\"\n3. **Get Feedback**: You tell them if they're right or wrong\n4. **Adjust**: The child remembers what they got wrong and improves\n\nNeural networks learn the same way! They look at thousands of examples, make predictions, get feedback, and gradually get better.\n\n## Why Are They Useful?\n\nNeural networks can:\n- Recognize faces in photos\n- Translate languages\n- Recommend movies on Netflix\n- Help doctors diagnose diseases\n- Drive cars autonomously\n\n## The Magic Behind It\n\nEven though neural networks seem complex, they're just really good at finding patterns in data. It's like having a super-smart assistant that never gets tired and can look at millions of examples to learn what makes a cat a cat.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nNeural networks are powerful tools that help computers learn and make decisions, just like humans do - but much faster and with the ability to process huge amounts of information!",
