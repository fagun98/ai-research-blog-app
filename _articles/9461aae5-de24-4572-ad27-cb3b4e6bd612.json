  "articleText":"## Title: How AI Can Learn Smarter, Not Just Bigger\n\nAre you ready for a big surprise about how AI learns? Think of it as your brain's super-smart twin! So, researchers have been studying this twin to find out if there's a smarter way to learn. They were surprised by what they found—it's not just about being bigger but also about using resources more wisely.\n\nImagine you're learning a new game and trying different moves until you get it right. Now, think of AI as doing the same thing with 100 billion tiny 'dials' inside its brain. Some dials are like the magic keys that help the AI learn faster—it doesn't need to spin all the dials; spinning these key ones is enough for the AI to get really good at the game!\n\nWhat's even cooler is they found out about this super-smart learning method by creating a 'treasure map'. This treasure map shows which 10 billion dials are important for certain games, allowing us to spend less time spinning and saving lots of energy in the process.\n\nNow here’s where it gets interesting: not only does it save energy, but it also saves resources like money too! It's like finding a shortcut on a road trip without compromising the journey—saving you fuel and time equally. \n\nBut there are dark sides to this story too. Imagine if every tech giant is racing each other just to spin more dials, burning up all our precious resources while leaving little space for others. That's not sustainable or fair. This paper tells us that focusing on the important 10 billion dials could make AI progress more efficient and accessible to everyone.\n\nFinally, imagine if your twin can learn smarter without using as much energy or money—it makes you wonder how smart other inventions might become!\n\nIn a nutshell, \"AI Progress Should Be Measured by Capability-Per-Resource, Not Scale Alone: A Fictional Look at the Future\" is like the ultimate learning cheat code for AI, helping it grow wiser with less wastefulness in our world.",
