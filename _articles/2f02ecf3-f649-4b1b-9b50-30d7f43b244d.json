  "articleText": "## Wi-Fi Router to the Rescue: New Way to Check if You're Taking Your Meds\n\nImagine your Wi-Fi router could tell if you took your medicine. Sounds like science fiction, right? But researchers at MIT and Harvard have come up with a clever idea that might just make it possible.\n\nThey developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model that can detect whether someone has taken their antidepressant medication by analyzing how they breathe during one night of sleep. The AI looks for tiny changes in breathing patterns that happen when you take certain medications.\n\nHere's the cool part: this technology doesn't require any invasive tests or special equipment. It can even work with a simple wearable belt or a contactless sensor that sits in your bedroom. No more daily blood tests or awkward questions about your pill-taking habits!\n\nThe researchers tested their AI on over 62,000 nights of sleep data and found it could accurately detect antidepressant use around 84% of the time. That's much better than current methods!\n\nThis breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by giving doctors a new tool to monitor patient adherence in real-time. Imagine being able to catch someone who might be struggling with side effects or forgetting their medication before it becomes a major problem.\n\nIt's an exciting example of how technology can help us improve our lives, one breath at a time!",
