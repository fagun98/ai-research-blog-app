  "articleText": "## The Valley of Code Reasoning: Scaling Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models\n\nImagine trying to teach a new language to someone who's never spoken before. You'd start with simple phrases and build upon them, right? But what if the person got confused by the simplest words and started speaking in a way that made no sense?\n\nThat's kind of like what happens when we try to teach AI models how to reason using \"knowledge distillation.\" We show them examples of how experts think through complex problems, but sometimes they get overwhelmed and start making mistakes.\n\n**The Valley: A Surprising Drop**\n\nResearchers found that with just 1,000 examples, the small AI model's performance actually dropped by more than half. It was like trying to learn a new language too quickly \u2013 it got confused and forgot what it already knew.\n\nBut then something amazing happened when they added more data (10,000 examples). The model started to recover and even surpassed its original baseline scores! This \"valley\" phenomenon is a crucial insight for AI developers who want to improve their models' reasoning abilities.\n\n**Don't Worry About Correctness**\n\nYou might think that showing the AI model correct reasoning would help it learn faster. But surprisingly, researchers found that whether the teacher's final answer was right or wrong didn't matter much in this stage of learning. The structure of the reasoning trace itself is what matters \u2013 not the outcome.\n\n**Easy Problems are Key**\n\nAnother important discovery was that focusing on easier problems yields better results than trying to tackle hard ones. It's like teaching a new language by starting with simple phrases and gradually moving on to more complex sentences. By mastering the basics, the model becomes more capable of handling tough challenges later on.\n\nSo what does all this mean for us? As AI models become increasingly important in our daily lives (e.g., healthcare, education), understanding how they learn is crucial for making them safer, more reliable, and beneficial to society. The valley of code reasoning may seem like a strange concept, but it has significant implications for the future of AI development.",
